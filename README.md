# REMP Mailer Skeleton

This is a pre-configured skeleton of REMP Mailer application with simple installation.

Mailer serves as a tool for configuration of mailers, creation of email layouts and
templates, and configuring and sending mail jobs to selected segments of users.

## Installation

### Docker

The simplest possible way is to run this application in docker containers. Docker Compose is used for orchestrating. Except of these two application, there is no need to install anything on host machine.

Recommended _(tested)_ versions are:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) - 20.10.5, build 55c4c88
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) - 1.29.0, build 07737305

#### Steps to install application within docker

1. Prepare environment &Â configuration files
```
cp .env.example .env
```
```
cp app/config/config.local.neon.example app/config/config.local.neon
```
```
cp docker-compose.override.example.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```

No changes are required if you want to run application as it is.

Note: nginx web application runs on the port 80. Make sure this port is not used, otherwise you will encounter error like this (when initializing Docker):

```
ERROR: for nginx  Cannot start service nginx: Ports are not available: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:80: bind: address already in use
```

In such case, change port mapping in `docker-composer.override.yml`. For example, the following setting maps internal port 80 to external port 8080, so the application will be available at http://mailer.press:8080.
```yaml
services:
# ...
  nginx:
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
```




2. Setup host 

Default host used by application is `http://mailer.press`.
It should by pointing to localhost (`127.0.0.1`), so add this to your local `/etc/hosts` file. 
In addition, please add MailHog as a default email testing tool. Use the following commands: 



```bash
echo '127.0.0.1 mailer.press' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo '127.0.0.1 mailog.mailer.press' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

3. Start `docker-compose`

```
docker-compose up
```

You should see log of starting containers.

4. Enter application docker container

```
docker-compose exec mailer /bin/bash
```

Following commands will be run inside container.

5. Update permissions for docker application

Owner of folders `temp` and `log` is user on host machine. Application needs to have right to write there.

```
mkdir temp log; chmod -R a+rw temp log
```

6. Install composer packages.

```
composer install
```

7. Install and build JS packages.

```
make js
```

8. Initialize and migrate database.

```
php bin/command.php migrate:migrate
```

9. Seed database with required data

```
php bin/command.php db:seed
```

10. (Optional) Seed database with demo data

```
php bin/command.php demo:seed
```

Access application via web browser. Default configuration:

- URL: http://mailer.press/
- User:
    - Email: `admin@admin.sk`
    - Password: `passphrase_change_me`
    
**IMPORTANT:** Please run steps 6-9 every time you update Mailer using `composer update`.

### Manual installation

Clone this repository and run the following commands inside the project folder:

```bash
# 1. Download PHP dependencies
composer install

# 2. Build JS and assets
make js

# 3. Run migrations
php bin/command.php migrate:migrate

# 4. Run seeders
php bin/command.php db:seed
php bin/command.php demo:seed # optional
```

You can override any default config from
[`config.neon`](./app/config/config.neon) by creating file
`config.local.neon` and setting your own values.
